Feature: View the list of data files
  In order to find what I need
  As a user
  I want to view a list of data files

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as "georgina@intersect.org.au"

  Scenario: View the list
    Given I have data files
      | filename     | created_at       | uploaded_by               | file_processing_status | experiment    |
      | datafile.dat | 30/11/2011 10:15 | georgina@intersect.org.au | RAW                    | My Experiment |
      | sample.txt   | 01/12/2011 13:45 | sean@intersect.org.au     | CLEANSED               | Experiment 2  |
    When I am on the list data files page
    Then I should see "exploredata" table with
      | Filename     | Date added       | Added by                  | Type     | Experiment    |

    And I should see "Showing all 2 files"

  Scenario: View the list when there's nothing to show
    When I am on the list data files page
    Then I should see "No matching files"

  Scenario: Must be logged in to view the list
