Feature: View the dashboard main page

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as "georgina@intersect.org.au"

  Scenario: Dashboard shows recent uploaded files
    Given I upload "sample1.txt" through the applet
    And I upload "WTC01_Table1.dat" through the applet
    When I am on the home page
    Then I should see "exploredata" table with
      | Filename         | Added by                  | 
      | WTC01_Table1.dat | georgina@intersect.org.au | 
      | sample1.txt      | georgina@intersect.org.au | 

  Scenario: Dashboard shows 5 most recent files
    Given I have data files
