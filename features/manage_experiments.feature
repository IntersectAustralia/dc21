Feature: Manage experiment metadata
  In order to make data more useful to others
  As a researcher
  I want to manage metadata about experiments

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as "georgina@intersect.org.au"
    And I have facilities
      | name                |
      | ROS Weather Station |
      | Tree Chambers       |
    And I have experiments
      | name             | description    | start_date | end_date   | subject | facility            | parent          | access_rights                                       |

  Scenario: View the list of experiments under a facility
    When I am on the view facility page for 'Tree Chambers'
    Then I should see "experiments" table with
      | Name             | Parent                       | Description |
      | Tree Chamber 01  | Facility - Tree Chambers     | Whatever    |
      | Tree Chamber 01A | Experiment - Tree Chamber 01 | Another     |
      | Tree Chamber 02  | Facility - Tree Chambers     | Whatever 2  |
