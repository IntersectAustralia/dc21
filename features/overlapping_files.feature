Feature: Overlapping Files
  In order to remove duplicate data
  As a technician
  I want to overwrite overlapped files
  And I don't want to overlap mismatching files

  Background:
    Given I have a user "researcher@intersect.org.au" with role "Institutional User"
    Given I have a user "other@intersect.org.au" with role "Institutional User"
    And I am logged in as "researcher@intersect.org.au"
    And I have experiment "My Experiment"

  Scenario: Safe overlap one file supplying description and experiment
    Given I upload "samples/subsetted/range_aug_1_aug_31/WTC01_Table1.dat" with type "RAW" and description "orig desc" and experiment "My Experiment"
    And I upload "samples/WTC01_Table1.dat" with type "RAW" and description "new description" and experiment "My Experiment"
    When I am on the list data files page
    Then I should see only these rows in "exploredata" table
      | Filename         | Added by                    | Type |
      | WTC01_Table1.dat | researcher@intersect.org.au | RAW  |
    When I follow the view link for data file "WTC01_Table1.dat"
    Then I should see details displayed
      | Type        | RAW             |
      | Description | new description |
      | Experiment  | My Experiment   |

  Scenario: Safe overlap one file inherits description
    Given I upload "samples/subsetted/range_aug_1_aug_31/WTC01_Table1.dat" with type "RAW" and description "orig desc" and experiment "My Experiment"
    And I upload "samples/WTC01_Table1.dat" with type "RAW" and description "" and experiment "My Experiment"
    When I am on the list data files page
    Then I should see only these rows in "exploredata" table
      | Filename         | Added by                    | Type |
      | WTC01_Table1.dat | researcher@intersect.org.au | RAW  |
    When I follow the view link for data file "WTC01_Table1.dat"
    Then I should see details displayed
      | Type        | RAW       |
      | Description | orig desc |

  Scenario: Safe overlap removes replaced files from carts and adds new one to carts
    Given I have uploaded "subsetted/range_oct_10_oct_12/weather_station_05_min_10_to_12.dat" with type "RAW"
    And I have uploaded "subsetted/range_oct_13_oct_15/weather_station_05_min_13_to_15.dat" with type "RAW"
    And the cart for "researcher@intersect.org.au" contains "weather_station_05_min_10_to_12.dat"
    And the cart for "researcher@intersect.org.au" contains "weather_station_05_min_13_to_15.dat"
    And the cart for "other@intersect.org.au" contains "weather_station_05_min_10_to_12.dat"
    Then the cart for "other@intersect.org.au" should contain 1 file
    And the cart for "researcher@intersect.org.au" should contain 2 files
    When I upload "samples/weather_station_05_min.dat" with type "RAW" and description "new description" and experiment "My Experiment"
    Then I should see "Carts have been updated."
    And I am on the list data files page
    Then I should see only these rows in "exploredata" table
      | Filename                   | Added by                    | Type |
      | weather_station_05_min.dat | researcher@intersect.org.au | RAW  |
    And the cart for "other@intersect.org.au" should contain only file "weather_station_05_min.dat"
    And the cart for "researcher@intersect.org.au" should contain only file "weather_station_05_min.dat"

  Scenario: Safe overlap doesn't show carts message if no files in carts
    Given I have uploaded "subsetted/range_oct_10_oct_12/weather_station_05_min_10_to_12.dat" with type "RAW"
    And I have uploaded "subsetted/range_oct_13_oct_15/weather_station_05_min_13_to_15.dat" with type "RAW"
    When I upload "samples/weather_station_05_min.dat" with type "RAW" and description "new description" and experiment "My Experiment"
    Then I should not see "Carts have been updated."
    And I am on the list data files page
    Then I should see only these rows in "exploredata" table
      | Filename                   | Added by                    | Type |
      | weather_station_05_min.dat | researcher@intersect.org.au | RAW  |
    And the cart for "other@intersect.org.au" should be empty
    And the cart for "researcher@intersect.org.au" should be empty

  Scenario: Identical file is considered a safe overlap and inherits description when none entered
    Given I upload "samples/subsetted/range_aug_1_aug_31/WTC01_Table1.dat" with type "RAW" and description "orig desc" and experiment "My Experiment"
    When I upload "samples/subsetted/range_aug_1_aug_31/WTC01_Table1.dat" with type "RAW" and description "" and experiment "My Experiment"
    And I am on the list data files page
    Then I should see only these rows in "exploredata" table
      | Filename         | Added by                    | Type |
      | WTC01_Table1.dat | researcher@intersect.org.au | RAW  |
    When I follow the view link for data file "WTC01_Table1.dat"
    Then I should see details displayed
      | Type        | RAW       |
      | Description | orig desc |

  Scenario: Identical file is considered a safe overlap and keeps entered description when entered
    Given I upload "samples/subsetted/range_aug_1_aug_31/WTC01_Table1.dat" with type "RAW" and description "orig desc" and experiment "My Experiment"
    When I upload "samples/subsetted/range_aug_1_aug_31/WTC01_Table1.dat" with type "RAW" and description "new desc" and experiment "My Experiment"
    And I am on the list data files page
    Then I should see only these rows in "exploredata" table
      | Filename         | Added by                    | Type |
      | WTC01_Table1.dat | researcher@intersect.org.au | RAW  |
    When I follow the view link for data file "WTC01_Table1.dat"
    Then I should see details displayed
      | Type        | RAW      |
      | Description | new desc |

  Scenario Outline: Outcome of all possible overlap scenarios (overlaps a single file only with identical content)
    Given I upload "samples/overlap_tests/8_9_10_oct.dat" with type "RAW" and description "orig desc" and experiment "My Experiment"
    When I upload "<new file>" with type "RAW" and description "new desc" and experiment "My Experiment"

  Scenario Outline: Overlaps scenarios where overlap checking doesn't come into play for various reasons
    Given I upload "samples/overlap_tests/8_9_10_oct.dat" with type "<old type>" and description "orig desc" and experiment "My Experiment"
    When I upload "<new file>" with type "<new type>" and description "new desc" and experiment "My Experiment"
    Then I should see "<message>"
    And file "<new file>" should have type "<resulting type>"
    And there should be files named "<files afterwards>" in the system
  Examples:
    | new file                                            | old type  | new type  | resulting type | files afterwards                              | message                     | comment                                           |

  Scenario: Overlap where new file safely overlaps multiple old files
    Given I upload "samples/overlap_tests/8_9_10_oct.dat" with type "RAW" and description "D1" and experiment "My Experiment"
    And I upload "samples/overlap_tests/11_oct.dat" with type "RAW" and description "D2" and experiment "My Experiment"
    When I upload "samples/overlap_tests/8_9_10_11_oct.dat" with type "RAW" and description "D3" and experiment "My Experiment"
    Then I should see "The file replaced one or more other files with similar data. Replaced files: 8_9_10_oct.dat, 11_oct.dat"
    And file "8_9_10_11_oct.dat" should have type "RAW"
    And there should be files named "8_9_10_11_oct.dat" in the system
    And there should be files named "8_9_10_oct.dat, 11_oct.dat" that were deleted

  Scenario: Overlap where new file safely overlaps one file but unsafely overlaps another
    Given I upload "samples/overlap_tests/8_9_10_oct.dat" with type "RAW" and description "D1" and experiment "My Experiment"
    And I upload "samples/overlap_tests/11_oct.dat" with type "RAW" and description "D2" and experiment "My Experiment"
    When I upload "samples/overlap_tests/9_10_11_oct.dat" with type "RAW" and description "D3" and experiment "My Experiment"
    Then I should see "File cannot safely replace existing files. File has been saved with type ERROR. Overlaps with 8_9_10_oct.dat"
    And file "9_10_11_oct.dat" should have type "ERROR"
    And there should be files named "8_9_10_oct.dat, 11_oct.dat, 9_10_11_oct.dat" in the system

  Scenario: Overlap where new file safely overlaps one file and doesn't overlap another at all
    Given I upload "samples/overlap_tests/8_9_10_oct.dat" with type "RAW" and description "D1" and experiment "My Experiment"
    And I upload "samples/overlap_tests/12_oct.dat" with type "RAW" and description "D2" and experiment "My Experiment"
    When I upload "samples/overlap_tests/8_9_10_11_oct.dat" with type "RAW" and description "D3" and experiment "My Experiment"

    When I upload "samples/toa5.dat" with type "RAW" and description "new TOA5" and experiment "My Experiment"
    Then I should see "The file replaced one or more other files with similar data. Replaced files: toa5.dat"
    And file "toa5.dat" should have parents "weather_station_15_min.dat,WTC01_Table1.dat,sample3.txt"
    And file "toa5.dat" should have children "package1.zip,Test_OCR.jpg"
    And there should be files named "toa5.dat, weather_station_15_min.dat, sample3.txt, WTC01_Table1.dat, package1.zip, Test_OCR.jpg" in the system

  #EYETRACKER-181
  @javascript
  Scenario: Overlap TOA5 file should not produce parent relationships where a file is both parent and child, should not be able to add child as parent during mass update
    Given I have uploaded "1.dat" with type "RAW"
    And I have uploaded "sample1.txt" with parents "1.dat"
    And I have uploaded "2.dat" with parents "sample1.txt"
    When I upload "samples/3.dat" with type "RAW" and description "Problem 2" and experiment "My Experiment"
    Then I should see "The file replaced one or more other files with similar data. Replaced files: 1.dat, 2.dat"
    And file "3.dat" should have children "sample1.txt"
    And file "3.dat" should have parents ""
    And I fill in "Parents" with "sample1.txt" within the file area for '3.dat'
    Then I should see "No matches found"
    And there should be files named "sample1.txt, 3.dat" in the system
