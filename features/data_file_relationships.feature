Feature: Edit data file relationships
  As a Researcher
  I want to define parent/child relationships between files
  so that I can capture the provenance / currency of a file

  Background:
    Given I have a user "admin@intersect.org.au" with role "Administrator"
    Given I have a user "researcher@intersect.org.au" with role "Researcher"
    And I have data files
