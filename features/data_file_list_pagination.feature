Feature: Paginating the list of data files
  In order to display data files
  As a user I want to paginate the data files list as many hundreds of files may be returned

  Background:
    Given We paginate more than 2 data files
    And I am logged in as "georgina@intersect.org.au"

  Scenario: No data files
    When I am on the list data files page
    Then I should see "No matching files"
    And I should not see the pagination area

  Scenario: Data files only have one page
    When I have data files
      | filename     | created_at       | uploaded_by               | file_processing_status | experiment  |
      | sample1.txt  | 01/12/2011 13:45 | sean@intersect.org.au     | RAW                    | Experiment4 |
    And I am on the list data files page
    Then I should see "Showing all 1 files"
    Then I should see "exploredata" table with
      | Filename     | Date added       | Added by                  | Type     | Experiment    |
      | sample1.txt  | 2011-12-01 13:45 | sean@intersect.org.au     | RAW      | Experiment4   |
    And I should not see the pagination area

  Scenario: Data files have more than one page
    When I have data files
      | filename     | created_at       | uploaded_by               | file_processing_status | experiment  |
      | sample1.txt  | 01/12/2011 13:45 | sean@intersect.org.au     | RAW                    | Experiment4 |

    And I am on the list data files page
    Then I should see "Showing all 5 files"
    And I should see "exploredata" table with
      | Filename     | Date added       | Added by                  | Type     | Experiment    |

      | sample2.txt  | 2011-12-01 12:45 | kali@intersect.org.au     | CLEANSED | Experiment2   |
    And I should not see link "Previous" in "the pagination area"
    And I should see link "Next" in "the pagination area"
    And I should not see link "1" in "the pagination area"
    And I should see link "2" in "the pagination area"
    And I should see link "3" in "the pagination area"
    When I follow "3" within the pagination area
    Then I should see "Showing all 5 files"
    And I should see "exploredata" table with
      | Filename     | Date added       | Added by                  | Type     | Experiment    |
