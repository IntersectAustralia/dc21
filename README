Intersect Australia Limited.

This is the DC21 Project, an ANDS-funded project being developed by Intersect in collaboration with the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at the University of Western Sydney.

This is a Rails (3.1) application for the management of environmental data (predominantly time-series from Campbell Scientific Loggers).

Key components are:
- A relational database (currently we're using Postgres, but others can be used)
- A file system for storing the uploaded data files
- An instance of The Mint (for lookup of FOR codes, this can be replaced with another source if desired)
- A mail server for sending email notifications (e.g. forgotten password)

Further documentation to come as the project progresses.
