DIVER (Data Is Vital for Empirical Research) is a general purpose, user-friendly research data capture and sharing application. It was originally developed by [Intersect Australia](http://www.intersect.org.au/) for the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at the Western Sydney Unversity as part of an ANDS-Funded Data Capture Project [DC21] (https://projects.ands.org.au/id/DC21). [ANDS](http://www.ands.org.au/) (Australian National Data Service) is an Australian Government research infrastructure project.

DC21 is a Ruby on Rails (3.2) application for the management of environmental data (predominantly time-series from Campbell Scientific Loggers).

Head over to [the wiki](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/dc21/wiki) for project documentation.
We also have a separate set of scripts that can run on logger-connected PCs and automatically load files into the system. This lives in [its own repository](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/restful-api-uploader). The wiki has details of how to set this up.
