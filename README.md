This is the DC21 Application. The DC21 application is being built by [Intersect Australia](http://www.intersect.org.au/) for the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at the University of Western Sydney as part of an [ANDS-Funded Data Capture Project (DC21)](http://www.ands.org.au).

DC21 is a Ruby on Rails (3.1) application for the management of environmental data (predominantly time-series from Campbell Scientific Loggers).

Head over to [the wiki](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/dc21/wiki) for project documentation.
We also have a separate set of scripts that can run on logger-connected PCs and automatically load files into the system. This lives in [its own repository](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/restful-api-uploader). The wiki has details of how to set this up.
