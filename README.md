**DIVER** (Data Is Vital for Empirical Research) is a general purpose, user-friendly research data capture and sharing application. DIVER was originally developed by [Intersect Australia](http://www.intersect.org.au/) for the [Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment](http://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie) at the [Western Sydney Unversity](http://www.westernsydney.edu.au/) as part of [ANDS](http://www.ands.org.au/) Data Capture Project [DC21] (https://projects.ands.org.au/id/DC21) in 2012/2013.

DIVER  is a Ruby on Rails (3.2) application for the management of environmental data, predominantly time-series from Campbell Scientific Loggers, but also for NETCDF, NCML format data and any general purpose data.

DIVER documentation is in the [DC21-DOC](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/dc21-doc) repository.
